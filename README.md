# TinyAra
An experiment focusing on simplicity and AFS-as-NFT

> *Brainstorm: TinyAra could be immutable archives with an ERC 721 representation. The holder of the NFT is the creator so rights can be transferable. I was thinking ERC 1155 as a way to represent federation for servers. ARA needs to be deployed to polygon and L2 networks. Archive rights can be bought and sold on opensea. I think the UI needs to be web based. Desktop app is a progressive web app. No electron.*
